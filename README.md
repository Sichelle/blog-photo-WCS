**About the project**

**Subject**

This is a project for a fictional client, created during 3 weeks in the <a href="https://wildcodeschool.fr/"> WildCode School </a>.
The theme of the website was to create a Blog / Portfolio of a photographer who's in love with Paris and his monuments.
We had to work in groups, composed by 4 people.
The goal of this project was to introduct us to the basis of the web, with a simple static website to create and to work in group.

We also had to use Git & Github to work together in the best way possible.

**Guidelines**

    - Groups of 3/4 people
    - Wireframe
    - Responsive
    - 3 pages minimum / 5 max
    - Framework Bootstrap
    - Contact form (front only)
    - Git & github (bonus: github pages)
    - Royalty-free photos

HTML CSS + JS, NO jQuery outside of bootstrap dependency
